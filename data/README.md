# Data

This data directory contains files that I am playing around with while prototyping

## wbminimal

A more minimal version of an entity that might be useful?

# jsonld

Exploration in the jsonld direction, but this might end up being far to complicated for that we need.
Though we might be able to take learnings fron this for whatever we create?

# csv

First look at CSV files, with some schema that can read from them?
Ultimately everything can be mapped to a CSV? and everything can be mapped from a CSV to Wikibase?
